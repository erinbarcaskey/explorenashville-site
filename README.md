# explorenashville-site
The Explore Nashville website was created for my first web development course. 

My team decided to create a site to share our favorite places in Nashville. I coded the site, wrote some content, and took pictures of some locations. The other members of the team wrote content and took pictures of some locations. 

The site was completed in 2017.
