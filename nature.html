		<img src="images/radnorlake1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Radnor Lake State Park" class="floatcenter">
		
		<p>Radnor Lake State Park encompasses over 1200 acres over 6 miles of trails, 
			and a variety of programs to keep everyone in the family busy - it's no 
			wonder that Radnor Lake see nearly one million visitors annually. 
			Radnor Lake can be accessed from two entrances. The east entrance 
			(off Granny White Pike) has the largest parking area and Nature Center 
			(with restrooms and maps). From the west, visitors can access Radnor Lake 
			from Franklin Road. This smaller parking area does have restrooms and 
			accesses both Otter Creek Road and the trail system. <br><br>As a "Class II" State 
			Natural Area, Radnor Lake has the most restrictive set of land management 
			rules of any state park. Of these, there are few that hikers should keep 
			in mind: no jogging/running on the trails, no off-trail hiking, no dogs/pets, 
			and no food or picnicking is allowed.</p>
